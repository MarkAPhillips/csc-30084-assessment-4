    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p>Third Party Integration</p>
<p>An exploration of the pros and cons for using third-party services for p=
ayments, notifications, and data reporting. The goal is to inform a strateg=
ic decision on the most effective integration of third-party services, and =
suggestions on areas where we could potentially develop a custom solution.<=
/p>
<h1 id=3D"ThirdPartyIntegrations-DiscussionofProsandConsbyUseCase">Discussi=
on of Pros and Cons by Use Case</h1>
<h2 id=3D"ThirdPartyIntegrations-1.PaymentsandFinancialTransactions">1. Pay=
ments and Financial Transactions</h2>
<p>This use case focuses on financial transactions, such as handling credit=
 card, debit, and third-party payments (e.g., PayPal).</p>
<p>Option 1: Using Third-Party Payment Processors</p>
<div class=3D"table-wrap">
<table data-table-width=3D"760" data-layout=3D"default" data-local-id=3D"56=
1ee4a3-24e1-4ea5-bd68-a1896902b984" class=3D"confluenceTable">

<tr>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>Pros</p></td>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>Cons</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Speed and Time-to-Market: Integrating a pre-built SDK or AP=
I is significantly faster than building a secure, robust payment system.</p=
>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Security and Compliance: Payment gateways handle complex se=
curity protocols, data encryption, and legal compliance, which removes this=
 burden from the project team.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Scalability and Reliability: These services are built to ha=
ndle high frequencies of transactions with high reliability.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Maintenance and Support: The third-party provider is respon=
sible for updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements, allowing the develo=
pment team to focus on core product features.</p>
<p></p></td>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Cost: Transaction fees and monthly charges can impact the p=
roject's cost as the user base grows.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Switching Third Party Providers: Switching third party serv=
ices can be a complex and time-consuming process.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Limited Customisation: Custom logic or unique payment flows=
 may be difficult to implement.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Dependency: The application's availability and performance =
for payments are dependent on the third-party service.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Assessment of "Easiest to Use": For payment processing, using a third-pa=
rty app is overwhelmingly the easiest and safest option. The initial integr=
ation effort is minimal compared to the massive undertaking of building and=
 maintaining a secure, compliant, and scalable system.</p>
<h2 id=3D"ThirdPartyIntegrations-2.NotificationsandMessaging">2. Notificati=
ons and Messaging</h2>
<p>This category covers sending transactional communications like confirmat=
ion emails, password reset links, or text messages for event registration.<=
/p>
<p>Option A: Using Third-Party Notification Services</p>
<div class=3D"table-wrap">
<table data-table-width=3D"760" data-layout=3D"default" data-local-id=3D"ed=

<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>Cons</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Reliability: These services specialize in high-volume messa=
ge delivery and are built for reliability, ensuring notifications are sent =
and delivered promptly.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Simplified Implementation: APIs abstract away the complexit=
ies of different delivery methods (email, SMS, push notifications), allowin=
g for a single integration point.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Scalability: These platforms are designed to handle massive=
 spikes in notification volume without performance issues.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Built-in Features: Often include features like message logs=
, delivery receipts, and templates, which are critical for an effective aud=
it trail as noted in the project requirements.</p></td>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Cost: Costs are typically based on the volume of messages s=
ent (e.g., per email or per SMS), which can become a significant.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Configuration: While the integration is straightforward, co=
nfiguring the services (e.g., setting up SMS numbers, email domains) requir=
es a degree of expertise.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Dependency: The ability to send notifications is entirely d=
ependent on the third-party provider's service status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Assessment of "Easiest to Use": Using a third-party service for notifica=
tions is the easiest and most robust solution. Building a custom system for=
 email and SMS delivery is a significant undertaking, requiring expertise i=
n areas like managing servers, handling bounces and spam filters, and estab=
lishing relationships with telecom providers.</p>
<h2 id=3D"ThirdPartyIntegrations-3.DataExtractionandReporting">3. Data Extr=
action and Reporting</h2>
<p>This category focuses on collecting data on attendance, popularity, and =
engagement to display on a dashboard.</p>
<p>Option A: Using a Third-Party Analytics Service (e.g., Google Analytics,=
 Mixpanel)</p>
<div class=3D"table-wrap">
<table data-table-width=3D"760" data-layout=3D"default" data-local-id=3D"86=

<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Rich Feature Set: These services provide a wide range of pr=
e-built dashboards, reports, and data visualization tools that would be dif=
ficult to replicate.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Ease of Setup: A simple SDK or JavaScript snippet can often=
 be added to the front-end code to start tracking events with minimal effor=
t.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Advanced Analytics: Many services include features like A/B=
 testing and user journey mapping out of the box.</p>
<p></p></td>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Data Ownership and Granularity: There is less control over =
the raw data. While data can be exported, the underlying database structure=
 may limit deep, custom analysis.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Cost: Pricing can be become expensive as application usage =
grows.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Data Silos: The application's data and the analytics data a=
re stored in separate systems, which can make it difficult to link them and=
 create a unified view.</p></td>

a, allowing for any type of analysis.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Flexibility and Customisation: The database schema can be d=
esigned to perfectly fit the application's data and reporting needs.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Cost-Effective: The project only pays for database hosting =
and a Power BI license.</p></td>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Development and Maintenance Overhead: The team is responsib=
le for designing the database, writing the code to log events, and ensuring=
 data quality. This is a significant effort.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Expertise Requirement: Someone with a strong understanding =
of database queries (e.g., SQL) and Power BI is required to build and maint=
ain the dashboards.</p>
<p>=C2=B7&nbsp; Scalability: The team is responsible for ensuring the datab=
ase can handle the volume of data, which can become a complex and expensive=
 problem.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessment of "Easiest to Use": Using a third-party analytics service is=
 the easiest way to get high quality, insightful data quickly. Building a c=
ustom database and linking it to Power BI gives ultimate control and is the=
 easiest long-term option if the team has the necessary expertise.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id=3D"ThirdPartyIntegrations-4.TranslationServices">4. Translation Serv=
ices</h2>
<p>This use case focuses on integrating a third-party service to provide re=
al-time translation for user-submitted content, specifically for the Q&amp;=
A sessions.</p>
<div class=3D"table-wrap">
<table data-table-width=3D"760" data-layout=3D"default" data-local-id=3D"04=
aa446d-5a93-4bab-824b-760f485648f2" class=3D"confluenceTable">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>Pros</p></td>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>Cons</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>Global Reach: Instantly makes the event accessible to a wider, non-Engli=
sh-speaking audience.</p>
<p>Reduced Development Time: Using a proven API from a major provider avoid=
s the need to build a complex, in-house translation model.</p>
<p>Scalability: Services like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are designed to=
 handle high volumes of translation requests, easily scaling with event siz=
e.</p>
<p>Improved User Experience: Delegates can ask questions in their native la=
nguage, removing a significant communication barrier.</p>
<p>Accuracy: Reputable services provide high-quality translations that are =
generally reliable for standard text.</p></td>
<td class=3D"confluenceTd">
<p>Cost: While many services have a free tier, costs can accumulate with hi=
gh usage. Pricing is typically based on the number of characters translated=
.</p>
<p>Potential for inaccuracies: Automated translations are not perfect and m=
ay sometimes fail to capture nuanced or technical language.</p>
<p>Latency: The process of sending text to an external API and receiving a =
response can incur delay, which could be noticeable in a live Q&amp;A sessi=
on.</p>
<p>Dependencies: The system would be reliant on an external service for a c=
ore functionality, meaning any outage or change in the third-party API coul=
d impact the user experience.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Assessment of "Easiest to Use": Most major translation APIs provide clea=
r documentation and SDKs for common programming languages. This makes them =
relatively easy to integrate from a developer's perspective. The key consid=
eration is the potential for managing API keys and usage limits within the =
platform.</p>
